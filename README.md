ðŸ¤– Local ChatGPT Clone
This is a lightweight, locally hosted chatbot application inspired by ChatGPT. It uses Gradio for the user interface and Ollama for running a local language model. The chatbot provides real-time responses to user prompts while maintaining conversation history. The project is designed to be simple, efficient, and privacy-focused, as it runs entirely on your local machine.
